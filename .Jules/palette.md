## 2024-03-24 - Redundant Alt Text & Secure Links
**Learning:** Decorative images (like logos) followed immediately by text should have empty alt attributes (`alt=""`) to prevent screen reader redundancy. External links opening in a new tab must include `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security and performance.
**Action:** Audit all image-text pairs and external links for compliance.
