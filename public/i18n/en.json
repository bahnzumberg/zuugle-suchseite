        "zuugle_erklaerung_1": "Zuugle is a search engine for hikes that can be reached by public transport.",
        "zuugle_erklaerung_2": "Zuugle offers the unique possibility of not only finding mountain tours but also how to get to them by public transport. Zuugle uses predefined criteria to look for available mountain tours on the internet and filters for those that are accessible by public transport. Since most tours do not start and end directly at a public transport stop, Zuugle also gives walking directions.",
        "wie_und_wofuer": "HOW AND WHAT CAN I USE ZUUGLE FOR?",
        "entwicklung_von_zuugle_1": "When developing Zuugle, we particularly focused on ease of use and clear presentation, so that you can find the right hikes for you with just a few clicks.",
        "entwicklung_von_zuugle_2": "Since Zuugle is a search engine, there is obviously a search bar on the homepage, divided into two parts. On the left you enter the place from which you want to travel. The righthand part is optional, for seeking specific mountain groups, sports or certain search words (e.g. \"Gastein\" or \"Wachau\"). The results of your search can now be displayed.",
        "entwicklung_von_zuugle_3": "On the results page, you can further refine your search with various filters, e.g. regarding arrival time, degree of difficulty, altitude difference and much more. In this way, you will find the tour that suits your current wishes.",
        "entwicklung_von_zuugle_4": "Now click on your desired tour. A tour description will appear on your screen, which you can also download as a PDF. For the Zuugle timetable suggestions for the next 7 days, click on the \"Arrival & Departure\" tab. Zuugle selects the best outward journey and shows you several return options.",
        "entwicklung_von_zuugle_5": "Please note that train cancellations or timetable changes at short notice may not be taken into account by our timetable suggestions. Therefore, please check your connection with the respective operators (bahn.de, oebb.at) before starting your journey. Click on the button of the tour portal to open a new window with the detailed tour description in the respective portal."
